# Smart-City-using-IoT
IoT is a system of interconnected devices which can collect and transfer data without human interference. Nowadays IoT is used in various sectors including industries, agriculture, medicine, smart city, etc. Our project is about a smart city including â€“ a smart home that measures temperature according to the environment, a smart garden that sprinkles water when needed, and a smart grid which is taking energy from the solar panel and transfers it to a power meter that charges the battery. Smart cities are modern urban concepts that are essential for people to live a quality life.
